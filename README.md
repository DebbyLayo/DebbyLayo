 ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Deborah from Nigeria! I'm a skilled and motivated Junior Data Analyst with a background in Urban and Regional Planning. I have strong passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights and making informed decisions based on the results. 
My interest in data analysis was sparked during my undergraduate studies where I utilized data obtained on any study area to design plans based on the inform decisions related to its sustainability and functionality. This early exposure to data analysis fueled my desire to delve deeper into the field.
To further develop my skills, I took a Google Data Analytics Complete Course, which solidified my knowledge in data analysis techniques and tools. Through this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the data analysis process, with a particular interest in data cleaning and the sharing stage.
